## Intrests in IT

My IT interest began at a young age when my Pop introduced me to his PC, at the time it was the most fascinating thing to me and still is to this day. The fact I was able to do everything I wanted on a computer just blew my mind. I could listen to music, create visuals, do schoolwork, browse the internet and do my favourite thing at the time and play Adventure Quest. From this when I learnt how to use most of the built-in programs, and I became fascinated with Windows Movie Maker and I used to make basic slideshow type videos with photos my family took and burn it to a DVD and sell it to them for $5 each. I then went on to using Adobe After Effects and editing videos for YouTube and gained experience in using it which I can still do to this day. 

I chose to study at RMIT University because I have always wanted to get educated when it came to IT, I wanted to learn things that I felt could benefit me in the long run and allow me to further my studies if I choose to do so.

What I expected to learn from studying at RMIT University was the ability to be able to work in a team and collaborate on projects. I was really hoping I would get the chance to create a website as well which is awesome since it’s what the first assignment is partly about and It made me excited to learn how to do so.

I would love the be a computer technician, I think it would be very beneficial for me because the worlds demand for computers is only growing and with computers comes the people needed to fix them if something goes wrong or to build them for specific needs. If that be a workstation for someone who needs it for demanding tasks such as video editing, music production and photo manipulation.

The responsibilities needed to be a computer technician include 

•	The ability to setup hardware
•	Install and update drivers if needed to the latest stable versions 
•	Install and configure software
•	Perform regular upgrades to ensure systems remain updated and secure
•	Troubleshoot system failures and bugs and then provide solutions to restore functionality
•	Keep records of repairs and fixes for future reference
•	The ability to install well-functioning LAN/WAN and other networks and manage the components such as servers, IPs etc.
The Requirements needed to be a computer technician include

•	Proven experience as a computer technician or a similar role
•	Experience with networking
•	Knowledge of computer systems and IT components 
•	Excellent troubleshooting skills
•	Good communication skills
•	Time management skills

The skills I currently have are ones that I have gained over the years just through my fascination with computers and IT. I can build a PC from scratch without fail and I can isolate a problem within a computer and then repair it from a hardware perspective. I am able to create visuals with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier and After Effects.

How I am going to obtain the skills, qualifications and experiences required to be a computer technician is to find a traineeship and if there isn’t any available in my area I will then work towards my certificate in IT or higher.
