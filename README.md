## Interests in IT

My IT interest began at a young age when my Pop introduced me to his PC, at the time it was the most fascinating thing to me and still is to this day. The fact I was able to do everything I wanted on a computer just blew my mind. I could listen to music, create visuals, do schoolwork, browse the internet and do my favourite thing at the time and play Adventure Quest. From this when I learnt how to use most of the built-in programs, and I became fascinated with Windows Movie Maker and I used to make basic slideshow type videos with photos my family took and burn it to a DVD and sell it to them for $5 each. I then went on to using Adobe After Effects and editing videos for YouTube and gained experience in using it which I can still do to this day. 

I chose to study at RMIT University because I have always wanted to get educated when it came to IT, I wanted to learn things that I felt could benefit me in the long run and allow me to further my studies if I choose to do so.

What I expected to learn from studying at RMIT University was the ability to be able to work in a team and collaborate on projects. I was really hoping I would get the chance to create a website as well which is awesome since it’s what the first assignment is partly about and It made me excited to learn how to do so.


### Ideal Job
Computer Technician 
http://www.domaynecareers.com.au/domayne/en/job/518205/computer-technician-watergardens?source=Indeed+Search+Engine

I would love the be a computer technician, I think it would be very beneficial for me because the worlds demand for computers is only growing and with computers comes the people needed to fix them if something goes wrong or to build them for specific needs. If that be a workstation for someone who needs it for demanding tasks such as video editing, music production and photo manipulation.

The responsibilities needed to be a computer technician include 

-	The ability to setup hardware
- Install and update drivers if needed to the latest stable versions 
- Install and configure software
- Perform regular upgrades to ensure systems remain updated and secure
-	Troubleshoot system failures and bugs and then provide solutions to restore functionality
-	Keep records of repairs and fixes for future reference
-	The ability to install well-functioning LAN/WAN and other networks and manage the components such as servers, IPs etc.

The Requirements needed to be a computer technician include

- Proven experience as a computer technician or a similar role
-	Experience with networking
-	Knowledge of computer systems and IT components 
-	Excellent troubleshooting skills
-	Good communication skills
-	Time management skills

The skills I currently have are ones that I have gained over the years just through my fascination with computers and IT. I can build a PC from scratch without fail and I can isolate a problem within a computer and then repair it from a hardware perspective. I am able to create visuals with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier and After Effects.

How I am going to obtain the skills, qualifications and experiences required to be a computer technician is to find a traineeship and if there isn’t any available in my area I will then work towards my certificate in IT or higher.

### Test Results
## Myers-Briggs Test Results 

I agree with the results of the Myers-Braggs test, I believe that I am an introverted person but can become an extroverted person in my comfort zone with familiar surroundings. Although I am an introverted person the test showed that I am intuitive and have a creative and imaginative mind.

I believe that I can be a valuable member of a team in both a workforce and a learning environment, although the test stated that I am an introvert, I can become comfortable and adjusted once settling into an activity. Having a prospecting trait ensures I can be an open and non-judgemental team member. 

When forming a team, I would take this into account by trying my hardest to be more extroverted and self-confident, and using my thinking trait to prioritize and be efficient. Ensuring I use my best initiative to succeed in team environment. 

## Online Learning Styles Test Results

The results of these tests showed me that I am a visual learner, I agree with this as a visual approach to learning tends to stick in my brain as opposed to a theoretical or auditory form of learning.

I believe these results could influence my behaviour in a team in a positive way, being a visual learner I could provide my notes or findings in a way that I find easy for me to learn and if someone in my team is stuck I could then give them my visual notes and they can see things from a visual perspective.

The way I should take this into account when forming a team is to try and find people with other learning styles and that way we can all collaborate our ideas and help each other if needed.

## Online Big 5 Personality Test

The results of the Big 5 test showed me that my openness trait is my highest which makes sense to me because I believe that I think in an abstract and complex way. I think that I am a creative person that loves to play around with ideas, and this is exactly what the test shows. It also shows that I am very high in neuroticism and I think this also makes sense since I experience one if not a combination of the following feelings; fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt and shame on a daily basis.

I believe these results could both negativity and positively impact my behaviour in a team the positives being that I can think outside the box and I can bring a creative view to the team/group. The negatives being that I may feel slight anxiety when working in a team and think I am the weakest link.

In the future when forming a team I will let them know of my positives and negatives and that way they will be understanding if I am a bit shy at first but when I warm up I’ll be the creative person that I love to be.

#Project Idea
The project I have come up with is an Australian inspired Battle Royale game. This would contain popular Australian landmarks and animals native to Australia to interact with, I would also like it to contain Australian vehicles to get around the game with. The aim of the game is there are 100 people in a Qantas lookalike plane and they need to jump out and fight to the death, the map will be closed in due to a dust storm that will kill players if they do not get into the centre of it. The last person that is left is crowned the king and wins the game.

The motivation for an Australian themed battle royale game is that there is nothing quite like it. The battle royale gaming market is currently booming with the likes of the game Fortnite and games similar such as Player Unknowns Battlegrounds. I believe an Australian battle royale game would be unique because there are many things native to Australia that could be implemented into a battle royale environment. Dangers such as Snakes, Dingos, Spiders and the harsh conditions of places such as Port Hedland, Alice Springs, Mount Isa and many more super-hot places could all come into play within a battle royale game with their own unique properties.

The way this game works is that 100 players start on a plane in the air that is flying over a large Australian themed map just like any other battle royale on the market at the moment but here is the twist. Half the map containing wildlife from colder biomes and and the other half of the map containing wildlife from hotter biomes in Australia. The player then chooses where he would like to eject from the plane, if he chooses to land on the colder side he is playing it a lot safer as there are a lot less dangers to worry about but lower chances at finding weapons and clothing, That being said the majority of the player count could drop for the same reason. If the player drops on the hotter side of the map, he is then choosing to take a riskier approach and in turn is able to access the higher tier weapons and clothing. Once the player has landed and has got his gear for the match, he has to watch out for other players in his surroundings trying to kill him for his loot and progress further into the game.

An average game lasts for around 20 – 30 minutes depending on how many people are eliminated at the start. The dust storm starts to activate in a circle surrounding the final area, this allows players to then find a vehicle or some sort of transportation to the centre. They can walk depending on how far away they are, if caught in the dust storm the player will them take consistent damage. The difference in this game to any other battle royal game is there is no healing and the damage you take from other players or dust storms carries on with you until the end of the game. 

The weapons and vehicles in this game are also unique from other battle royale games on the market as I would like to try and take realistic approach with the game. Something that not many other battle royale games try and achieve, for the vehicles I have chosen 4-wheel drives, ATV’s and dirt bikes as the transportation in this game as I think that they are the common ways of moving around the outback and bushlands of Australia. The weapons in this game also taking a realistic approach are basic weapons such as Bats, Spears, Bow and Arrows for the low tier and pistols, shotguns and rifles for the higher tier weapons. 

At the end of the game the last person left receives a prize for being the last man standing which could be in the form of a in game cosmetic or in game currency to keep the player base wanting to win and to try and keep the game consistent and enjoyable which is something not many battle royales are able to do since the game is the same every single time and usually getting nothing out of the it in the end.

The software needed to develop the game would be Unity Engine because it is easy to use, easy for people to programme on, available for any current generation platform has collision detection without mathematics and allows for endless possibilities. The hardware side you need a Workstation with higher specs such as a high-end workstation graphics card such as a NVIDIA Quadro, high end CPU such as a Intel Core i9-7980XE, a high amount of RAM, 32GB, 64GB being practical. The addition of a solid-state drive over a standard mechanical hard drive would be efficient to faster load assets and work inside of Unity.

The skills required to be a game developer are the ability to write code to turn the concepts into a playable game, the ability to program the games terrain and turn it from a concept into a playable game environment. I also believe a game of this size would need a team of people to work on it which means that another skill needed is to be a team player, working together would be crucial to completing the game. Another skill needed would be art skills to complete cover art or concepts for the game that game developers could then turn into the playable game.

If my project is successful, the outcome would be that the game would be available on all consoles including PS4, Xbox, Switch and PC/Mac. If successful the game would receive consistent updates to keep the bugs to a minimum and the playability to a maximum adding content with every update to keep the game interesting.  Hopefully leading to a follow up game based in another part of the world with all new weapons, vehicles and environment.
If the game is successful through digital downloads I would hope to eventually release it as a physical copy with any addons that the game had over the span of time of it being digital.
